Pixar Luxo Jr Animation
========

### Descirption
This project simulates the Luxo Jr animation sequence of the Pixar Animation.The video of animation is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4NPQ8mfKU0). Though the animation is quite sophisticated , I have made a rudimentary simulation in which the motion of the lamp can be controlled.

### Usage
* **make** builds the project and outputs a binary.
* Building the project requires freeglut-dev , g++ , make tools on a linux system. Building on platforms other than linux has not been tested.
* Double left click on the bianry to run the simulation.


### Controls
1. F5,F6: Sideways rotation of lamp head 
2. F7: Hit the ball if the ball is near the lamp.
3. F8,F9: Up-down movement of head of lamp.
4. F10: The head of lamp rotates sideways to look sideways.
5. F11: Moves the lamp in jumping manner towards the direction the head is facing 
6. F12: Gives a push to ball .
